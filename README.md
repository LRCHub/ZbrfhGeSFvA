[00:06.73] You said that you'd never
[00:09.10] Forget me, how you could leave me behind?
[00:13.44] Promise me you'll be there
[00:16.12] For the good and there for the darkest nights
[00:19.67] You said you'd swim the deepest oceans
[00:22.10] Rip the stars right from the sky
[00:26.41] Oh, you said that you'd never
[00:29.92] Forget me, we'd have each other for life
[00:49.92] 
[00:33.52] I could paint over the scars
[00:37.02] Take an arrow to the heart
[00:40.41] No, I don't care where you've been
[00:43.10] Just don't leave me lonely again
[00:47.57] I could learn to picture you
[00:50.56] From a different point of view
[00:54.45] No, I don't care where you've been
[00:57.62] Just don't leave me lonely again
[01:13.62] 
[01:01.47] You are my oxygen
[01:03.71] But somehow you still make me forget to breath
[01:07.73] Yeah, I'd go through hell again
[01:11.04] For you 'cause it feels like heaven to me
[01:14.05] I'd crush diamonds, run from sirens
[01:17.52] Be the world beneath your feet
[01:21.15] Oh, you said that you'd never forget me
[01:25.69] I'm yours for eternity
[01:36.69] 
[01:28.44] I could paint over the scars
[01:32.17] Take an arrow to the heart
[01:35.65] No, I don't care where you've been
[01:38.70] Just don't leave me lonely again
[01:42.32] I could learn to picture you
[01:45.67] From a different point of view
[01:49.37] No, I don't care where you've been
[01:52.86] Just don't leave me lonely again
